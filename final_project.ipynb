        "# Using Satellite Imagery and Machine Learning for Urban Heat Risk Analysis in San Francisco\n",
        "\n",
        "> Background\n",
        "\n",
        "    Urban heat risk is a growing concern in many cities around the world, including San Francisco. The rapid urbanization and industrialization of San Francisco. have led to the emergence of urban heat islands, characterized by higher temperatures in densely built-up areas compared to surrounding suburban areas. This phenomenon poses significant health risks to residents, especially during heat waves, and can exacerbate existing socioeconomic inequalities.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Problem Statement\n",
        "\n",
        "    The main objective of this project is to assess the urban heat risk in San Francisco. over the past 5 years using satellite imagery and machine learning. The analysis will identify areas with high heat risk and help city planners and policymakers implement targeted interventions to reduce heat exposure, particularly for vulnerable populations.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "    For this project, I will use publicly available Landsat 8 satellite imagery through the Google Earth Engine of San Francisco in 2020. The Landsat 8 images provide high-resolution (30-meter) data in multiple spectral bands, including the thermal infrared band, which is essential for calculating land surface temperature. Then I use Python script that utilizes the Google Earth Engine (GEE) Python API to download Landsat 8 satellite imagery for the year 2020 over San Francisco with less than 5% cloud cover. The script loops through each image in the resulting image collection, exports them as GeoTIFF files, and uploads them to a Google Cloud Storage bucket named ‘sf_imagery’. Moreover, GeoTIFF images can be extracted from the specified Google Cloud Storage bucket."

The vegetation indices are clipped to the region of interest, and then added to a Folium map, along with the San Francisco neighborhood boundaries as a GeoJSON layer.
